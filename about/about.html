        <p>
          I am a husband, father to four awesome adult daughters, and grandpa to
          three grandchildren. I'm retired now and live in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

          My first career was in information systems in the early 80's and
          involved programming in COBOL for a gas utility company. Back then
          everyone worked in cubicles, isolated to maximize productivity!
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked writing code but the corporate cubicle just didn't work for
          me, so I returned to university for a teaching degree. For 25 years I
          taught physics, general science, math, and some computer science, and
          coached hockey (briefly), and golf for about 20 years. There were both
          good years, and very trying one's too. There were times I longed to
          have my cubical back!
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on experience I would say that most teachers also have a love of
          learning. I started experimenting with web development in the late
          nineties and found it had both creative and technical aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continue to enjoy web development but keep it a hobby, so I can work
          on what interests me. Learning new things keeps me going.
        </p>

          Golf is another passion of mine. After over 40 years of playing, I
          like that there are always ways of improving, even in my sixties. I
          don't hit it as far as I once did but my short game now makes up for
          most other shortcomings. I wish I'd realized this in my youth, I could
          have been a pretty good player. My handicap is still in the single
          digits though and I enjoy playing as much as when I started. Iâ€™m lucky
          to have a spouse who plays too!
