            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              This blog is a collection of posts related to prostate cancer,
              beginning with checkups, the diagnosis, subsequent surgery, and
              the ongoing recovery. Although your urologist will give you some
              reading materials to help guide you through the experience, there
              were many things I wish I’d known about the surgery and recovery
              beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hopefully I can help you navigate the twists and turns involved in
              this journey so that you can be prepared for every stage of your
              treatment.

            <h3>Monitoring</h3>
            <p>
              Starting in my early fifties my family doctor included a check for
              PSA in my blood work that accompanied regular checkups. A PSA test
              is a blood test used to screen for prostate cancer. The test
              measures the amount of
              <em
                ><span style="color: var(--blood-orange)"
                  >prostate-specific antigen</span
                ></em
              >
              (PSA) in your blood.
            </p>
            <p>
              When my PSA levels began to climb, I was referred to a urologist
              who took over and scheduled regular prostate exams.
            </p>
            <p>
              This continued for roughly ten years as my PSA levels continued to
              climb. Roughly every second year a biopsy was done. This involves
              taking a dozen or so samples using a spring like device that
              impacts the prostate gland and removes a tiny amount of tissue
              which is analyzed. The problem with this is that none of the
              samples collected may be from an area of concern that could be
              cancerous. Also, not all parts of the prostate can be targeted for
              sample collection, for example the prostate gland has one side
              that is inaccessible because it rests against the bowel wall. One of
              these biopsies had a very small area that concerned my specialist
              and he began to keep a close eye on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January 2022 my urologist informed me that my PSA readings were
              high enough to be concerning and suggested another biopsy, or as
              an alternative, a CT scan which would be scheduled at a hospital.
              I chose the CT scan and continue to be happy I did. It results in
              a complete image of the gland and in my case, a visible area
              showing a cancerous growth. I would recommend requesting a CT scan
              if you've already had a few biopsies.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="diagnosis">
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>
              I can’t say I was surprised when the diagnosis came back that I
              definitely had prostate cancer. It seemed that this was the
              direction things were headed over the decade or so of monitoring,
              biopsies, and the eventual scan.
            </p>
            <p>Still, it’s a gut punch to hear it.</p>
            <p>
              If you’re going to get cancer though, prostate cancer would be the
              kind to have since its one of the slowest growing types. As long
              as detection is early, the prognosis is generally very good.
            </p>
            <p>In my case there are three treatment options:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Radiation</h4>
                <p>
                  The problem with this is that if your prostate cancer returns
                  later on you can’t then do option 2. You would have to do
                  chemotherapy. While not as invasive as surgery, there are
                  still side effects.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>
                  Radical Prostatectomy and Bilateral Pelvic Lymphadenectomy
                </h4>
                <p>
                  This involves the complete removal of the prostate gland as
                  well as lymph nodes close to the prostate gland. I chose this
                  option as it was recommended by my urologist and I liked the
                  idea of having the cancerous growth gone! My urologist warned
                  me though that the recovery is at least three months (no full
                  golf swings or strenuous activity) and the first 2-3 weeks are
                  especially tough having a catheter for two weeks is standard
                  procedure. Expect to stay in the hospital for 4-5 days before
                  being discharged. This is a major operation, I was in the
                  operating room for roughly 3.5 hours and afterwards you’ll
                  have internal stitches, external staples as well as a drain
                  for fluid that collects around the incision.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>Robotic-assisted Radical Proctectomy</h4>
                <p>
                  This sounded good but was not available in Manitoba as of June
                  2022.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              My follow up appointment where these options were presented to me
              was in early April. I was told that a surgery date would probably
              be in August or September. I remember thinking that it could be
              longer than that if another wave of Covid came and surgeries
              started getting cancelled again!
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first week of June, I got a package in the mail indicating
              my surgery was scheduled for June 29. I felt relieved that I had a
              date soon enough that Covid might not have time to build up again,
              but it made for a very short golf season as our spring was so cold
              and wet with flooding that most courses didn’t open until the
              second week in May.
            </p>
            <p>Still sooner was definitely better than later!</p>

        <section id="hints">
          <h3>Things You'll Need</h3>
          <p>
            None of the pamphlets I got mentioned what you’ll need when you go
            home after your surgery. So, before your surgery date you'll want to
            round up the following items.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would recommend picking up adult diapers. This is because there
            will be oozing from around the catheter tube which includes some
            blood that has pooled following surgery. These saved ruining many
            pairs of underwear and pants! If you are
            <em
              ><span style="color: var(--blood-orange)">really lucky</span></em
            >
            you won’t have this and the diapers can be returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also get absorbent pads for when the catheter is removed.
            Many men have some degree of incontinence at this stage. What
            research I did said that this usually rights itself eventually but
            at the beginning you will definitely want some protection for your
            clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To clean your catheter bag, you’ll need a squirt bottle (or a
            syringe) something like the one shown. It needs to have a spout
            small enough to shoot the cleaning liquid (vinegar and water) into
            the catheter tube. I got this one at a dollar store.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a link to a video that goes through the general care of your
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_yVxoxp0E8"
              target="_blank"
              >urinary drainage bag</a
            >. The cleaning instructions are at approximately the 12:00 minute
            mark. My bag's instructions were to use vinegar and water rather
            than bleach as in the video.

                Had trouble changing the dressing for my drain and was told to
                go the emergency ward. Eight hours later when at home I noticed
                that there was no urine in the urinary bag at all. Wasn't
                feeling very good, called an ambulance, 90 minutes later it
                still had not come! <strong>(EPIC FAIL City of Winnipeg)</strong>.<br>
                I got a neighbour to drive me to the
                emergency ward again and arrived there at 8:00 p.m.<br />
                Got home this time at 3:30 am. The doctor there told me that I
                probably got dehydated while waiting in the first emergency ward
                but all was functioning properly now.

                I was supposed to get the drain removed after 7 days but lymph
                was still bypassing the drain itself and soaking the dressing
                covering it. The removal is postponed for a few days. The drain and
                catheter are equally uncomfortable at this point.
              </p>
              <p class="desc-item">
                I looked forward to getting the drain, catheter, and staples

              <p class="desc-item">
                HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT! My surgeon wanted to just remove the drain
                and staples, then after 5 additional days the catheter. He felt
                that doing all three at the same time would be too much, which
                I'm sure was true. The next 5 days passed by very slowly but at
                last I was able to have a shower instead of a sponge bath now

                This was not an issue though, urine flowed non-stop at first
