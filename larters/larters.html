            <h3>No Cap Match Play</h3>

            <p>
              The No Cap Matchplay league is a new pilot project this season
              that is designed to let players play singles match play against
              others close to their own handicap index thus eliminating the need
              for strokes. For more information about next year's version
              contact Ted at <b>ted.shapera@gmail.com</b>.

            <h3>General News & Wrap Up (October 13)</h3>

            <p>
              With only one more week of golf at Larter’s it's time to look back
              on what worked with the league and what can be improved for next
              season.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most of the feedback regarding the league has been positive. Our
              biggest issue was running out of golf season and getting all of
              the matches in. Next year we’ll start earlier to avoid this
              problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              I will look into whether it would be possible to have a set day
              for league play such as Mondays (no other leagues other than
              Senior Interclub in the mornings and less tournaments), which
              would help alleviate the problem of scheduling matches to some
              degree.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you enjoyed playing in the league and know of others who might
              be interested please ask them to email me (<b
                ><i>ted.shapera@gmail.com</i></b
              >) and I’ll add them to the mailing list for next season.
            </p>

            <h4>Blue-White Division</h4>

            <p>
              Time running out was definitely an issue as 14 out of 30 matches
              remained to be played. Cole was leading with 10.5 points and one
              match remaining, Josh was in second with two matches left, and
              Chris was in third place with three matches left to play. It would
              have been a good finish if only we had a few more weeks to play.
            </p>

            <h4>Eggshell Division</h4>

            <p>
              Congrats to all players in this division as all matches were
              completed! Aaron finished first with 10 points, and Justin had a
              strong finish earning 6 points in his last two matches to finish
              in second with 7.5 points, and Dan was third with 4.5 points
            </p>

            <h4>Beige Division</h4>

            <p>
              Arranging matches was a challenge here as only Keegen was able to
              play all four matches, he was leading with 5 points but could have
              been caught by any other player as all three had two matches to
              play.
