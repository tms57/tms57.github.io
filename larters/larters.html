            <h3>The Problem With Handicaps</h3>
            <p>
              Many lower handicappers have lost interest in playing net events
              over the last few years. In can seem that the odds are stacked
              against you when playing high handicappers. One hilarous example
              was this YouTube rant I watched about a guy who made a hole-in-one
              and lost to a 2 net zero!

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>
              The answer may be in playing opponents having handicaps within a
              stroke or two of your own and not having to worry about strokes at
              all.

        <section id="concept1">
            <h3>Concept 1: By Index Groups (0-18 handicappers)</h3>
            <p>
              Five divisions of players divided into smaller groups within a few strokes of each other.
            </p>

        <section id="concept2">
            <h3>Concept 2: By Tees (0-18 handicappers)</h3>
            <p>
              All players up to 18 handicaps play in one group BUT play from different tees based on skill level. The tee box each player plays from is the compensation instead of strokes.
