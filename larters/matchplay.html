            <h3>No Cap Match Play</h3>
            <p>
              Last season the <b>No Cap Singles Match Play League</b> ran as a pilot project. The idea was to have players organized into groups of ideally 8-10 players whose handicaps were within ± 2 strokes of each other. The target here was lower handicappers (max index of 17.9) and competition was "straight up" with no strokes involved. An additional benefit is to play guys who you might not meet otherwise and perhaps acquire a new golf buddy or two.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="how-it-works">
            <h3>How It Works</h3>

            <p>
              Once registration closes players will be organized into divisions
              of 6 to 10 participants. This will be <u>based on your current Golf
              Canada handicap as of April 7, 2025</u>. The divisions depend on the
              total number of players and the distribution of their handicaps.
              I'm hoping for three or four divisions of 6-10 players.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>You MUST have a current Golf Canada index of 17.9 or lower</b> and scores posted
              regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we have divisions set up you will receive an email with a
              link to this website where the schedule of opponents and dates by
              which these matches need to be played by will be posted. It is then up to you and your opponent to arrange a tee time for your match. This website will include updated standings each week as well as news
              you might need to see. <b>I would recommend bookmarking this site</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Registration will close on May 13 and we will start the week of May 19.
              The league should be finished by the end of August at the latest. There will
              be extra time built into the schedule to allow for club events
              such as the the Adidas Cup, the Two Man Matchplay, and Club Championship.

        <p>Please <b>submit all cards</b> from matches to the proshop, they have an envelope for them.</p>
        <p>It also helps if the winner emails me the results with an image of the scorecard attached.  This allows me to keep up more easily, but is not required.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h4>Can we play our match at another course if my opponent and I agree?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. All matches must be played at Larters - in case of rulings etc.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I get a refund if I have to withdraw?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No! This is why there was all that text about making sure you actually had the time to play etc. PLEASE DON’T DO THIS TO YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS - it would really mess up the division you are in!
        </p>

        <h4>What if a player withdraws due to injury or illness?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Injuries and illness cannot be helped. If the injury/illness is only a few weeks then matches can be made up later. If the player is out of action for the summer then any <u>completed matches</u> involving that player will be deleted, in other words whether those matches were won or lost, they won’t count. This is the only fair way to proceed since some players would never get the chance to play their match with the withdrawn player while others who did may have points from these matches. Let’s hope we all stay healthy!
        </p>

        <h4>What if my opponent and I can’t agree on a drop or other ruling?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Take a picture of the situation (if possible) and then play 2 balls from that point to the completion of the hole (one with the drop and one with no drop - make sure the two balls are not the same number!!!). After completion of the match, show the image (if there is one) or explain the predicament to any pro in the proshop for a ruling. <b>The proshop ruling will be final for any situation!</b><br />
          (This has not happened yet and hopefully it doesn’t occur!)
        </p>

        <h4>I’ve tried numerous times to arrange my match with an opponent but he never seems to be able to play. Now what?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          If you have tried 3 times and have not been successful, email me with the details. I will help get the match scheduled.
        </p>

        <h4>What is the tiebreaker if two players finish with the same point total?</h4>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Whichever player won the match (2 or more points) between the two tied players with will finish ahead of the other.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          If the two players tied their match (1.5 points each) then a count-back will be used starting on the 18th hole of their head-to-head match to determine who finishes ahead.
