              This project is a YouTube course to allow beginners to build their own basic website for any interests and passions they may have. Perhaps it’s a cycling, running, book, or cards club. Maybe a softball, bowling, or golf league, or even just a personal blog or journal.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all have something we're passionate about!
            </p>
              These types of sites don’t necessarily require learning Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress or the ongoing monthly expense either.
            </p>

            <p>
              Learning to code a basic site is not as challenging as you might think. I’ll play the role of curator sending you to some excellent YouTube channels where you’ll learn the needed basics and then we’ll put to use what you’ve learned to build some basic websites together.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you’re game to learn something new, have some spare time, and a little bit of curiosity about how things work “under the hood”, you would probably like designing and coding you own website.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can upload your files using a free app called Github Desktop and have your site hosted for free on github.com – I’ll take you step by step through all of this.
