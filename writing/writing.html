            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
              I've always thought about writing but just hadn't managed to get
              started. Then the pandemic came along and suddenly there was
              plenty of time. That and there was precious little else to do!
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by writing some stories based on recollections of my
              teaching days. Then I came across writing sites like
              <strong>Reedsy</strong> and <strong>Story Unlikely</strong>. I
              started working on some of their writing prompts and then actually
              submitted a story now and then. I haven't won any prizes but I do
              like the creative process of writing and using the other side of
              my brain too!
            </p>

              <h5>Writing Prompt</h5>
              <p>
                This story was submitted to Reedsy. The prompt was to write a
                story about good friends. Length: 1000 - 3000 words.

            <p>
              When I was in my late teens tennis was my obsession. I began
              playing tournaments. Here in Manitoba, Canada there used to be 3
              levels: A, B, and C. I lived in the middle level, B. At
              tournaments though there were no cliques, everyone socialized
              together.
            </p>
            <p>
              I watched Glen's matches often because he played a style of tennis
              I liked. As an "A" level pro there was a lot I could learn by
              watching him play. He won the Manitoba Open at least once in the
              late 70's. In terms of tennis, we didn't have much in common and
              we remained acquaintances. In the early 90’s I started playing
              golf regularly, played less tennis, and gradually drifted away
              from the tennis crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1998 I had recently joined a golf club and as I walked out to
              the driving range one morning I noticed a tall familiar figure
              hitting balls. I hadn't seen Glen in over a decade. Unlike with
              tennis, we shared similar golf skills and formed a close
              friendship as we began playing regularly. As an added benefit Glen
              introduced me to his golf buddies and soon I was part of a regular
              group of a half dozen players.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon we were phoning each other to arrange epic “Shell Wonderful
              World of Golf” matches against each other but also to discuss any
              number of other topics. Our friendship came along at a crucial
              time as I was going through a divorce.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm the kind of person who doesn't make friends all that easily,
              I've never had a wide circle of people who could be described as
              close. Looking back on it I never formed friendships with fellow
              teachers because I preferred a separation between my work and
              private life, plus I got enough shop talk at work. There has
              always been more acquaintances than friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s strange sometimes how people are going through opposite
              experiences. While I was adjusting to life as a divorced father of
              two, Glen had begun a new relationship and seemed to be on top of
              the world. Soon he was newly married and talking about the new
              house they were building. It was great to see him so happy and I
              took some encouragement in seeing that it was possible that I
              could one day be in a good marriage too!
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually I began getting "out there" a little. I joined a
              singles club and began dating. Each week Glen and the other golf
              buddies would ask about any dates there may have been since we
              last played. I had some interesting stories about some
              uncomfortable evenings out and my endeavors to wrap them up as
              soon as possible. Since I was only one of two single guys in our
              group, they looked forward to hearing any "reports" I had to
              share.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a few years of single clubs and dating I had come to the
              conclusion that I needed to take a break from it all. I had one
              purchased event left and I figured that I 'd just go and at least
              eat the included dinner and then stop going altogether. Then
              everything changed!
            </p>
            <p>
              I met Lorraine at this last event. I still remember how striking
              she was in the white jeans and pink top she wore that night, how
              easy she was to talk with, and her sense of humour. I remember
              seeing some of the attendees playing shuffleboard and asking if
              she would like to partner up and play. "We'll kick their butts;
              they'll never know what hit them!" was her reply.
            </p>
            <p>
              As if this wasn't enough, she golfed too! When I asked her out for
              nine holes of golf and dinner afterward her reply was “Sure, but
              you’ll need to bring your A-game!" I was hooked!
            </p>

            <p>
              Glen was happy for me and soon made the suggestion that led to
              some of the most enjoyable days of my life. He said “Freddie (his
              nickname for me that he and our golf buddy Brent had given me
              after the tour pro Fred Couples), the four of us should go play”.
              Soon it was decided that the most even way to make teams would be
              Glen being a partner with Lo, and Brent and I would be the
              opposition.
            </p>

            <p>
              There were numerous matches with taunting and teasing. Often Glen
              would phone to set up all the details of a big match and then he’d
              say “Ok, put my partner on, we have to talk strategy”. He always
              called Lo “Partner”. He would joke that if it was too tense for Lo
              to drive out to the golf course with the opposition (me) he could
              come by and pick her up! If Lo told him about shooting a good
              score he would laugh and advise her not to post the good games on
              the handicap system until after our match in case her handicap
              went down!
            </p>

            <p>
              We also began taking four or five-day golf trips to Detroit Lakes.
              Glen, Brent, Wade, and I would play at four of about a dozen
              terrific courses in the area. We would play each day with a new
              partner and then rehash all the highlights (and bloopers) over
              dinner. Our favorite place was Zorbas in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.
              I knew even then that those would be some of my most cherished
              memories later in life.

            <p>
              When I suffered with back issues for about six years Glen would
              always phone to see how my recovery was progressing. We would talk
              in person or by phone for hours about health, golf, and sports. We
              didn’t always agree but I always enjoyed the conversations.
              Especially about the Jets concerning the team’s players, trades,
              and draft choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              When Glen was diagnosed with kidney cancer, I would call to chat
              about how he was doing. He never complained about getting sick or
              asked “why me?” He was always upbeat saying how it was one step at
              a time and that he would get back to a full recovery day by day.
              Although there were several setbacks along the way he remained
              positive.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was recovering from
              surgery the roles reversed and he encouraged me, and met me for
              lunch often helping me to remain positive. We were both surviving
              cancer at the same time and encouraging each other.
            </p>

            <p>
              In early September 2022, we met for lunch with another friend on a
              flawless fall day. Glen and I were feeling that we were on the
              home stretch of our recoveries and that we could perhaps play nine
              holes and ride a cart so that we didn’t try to do too much too
              quickly. It would feel great to return to doing something normal
              and we agreed to arrange this on the weekend for the next week.
            </p>

            <p>
              When my phone rang that Thursday and I saw his name on my phone I
              answered as I always have: “Ernie…how’s it going?” (Ernie was his
              nickname because his height and swing reminded me of the South
              African golfer Ernie Els). It wasn’t Glen though; it was his wife.
              I just knew by the sound of her voice…
            </p>

            <p>
              He had suffered a brain hemorrhage as a complication of his recent
              gamma-knife surgery. He was unresponsive and quickly lapsed into a
              comma with no measurable brain activity. I can’t imagine how
              difficult it must have been for her to have to struggle with the
              decision to take him off life-support. Mercifully he passed away
              just before she had to authorize this. Even though we knew that
              his long-term odds weren’t that good, it was a shock how suddenly
              it happened. One month later my other golf partner Brent passed
              away of esophageal cancer, going from initial diagnoses to his
              last day in less than three months. It was a tough fall and it hit
              me hard.
            </p>

            <p>
              Late last October we had some beautiful warm days past the usual
              end of our golf season here. I woke up and looked out my window
              and almost reached for the phone to call Glen and figure out when
              and where we should play. I still have these moments where I
              blissfully forget for just a second that he’s really gone. The
              Jets will play a good (or bad) game, Donald Trump will do another
              ridiculous thing, or as just happened last weekend, Nick Taylor (a
              Canadian) won the Canadian Open. Just for a second, I find myself
              thinking I should call “Ernie” or half expect my phone to ring.
            </p>

            <p>
              We still meet his wife for dinner every now and then. The last
              time I asked her if I could buy his Ping driver from her. Glen and
              I used to joke about him selling it to me and he used to say
              “Freddie I can’t do that – it would come back to haunt me!”. Her
              response was “I want you to have it but you can’t blame him for
              any shitty shots!” I assured her that I wouldn’t, but that I might
              hear his voice from somewhere asking “Freddie, what happened
              there?”
            </p>

            <p>
              That driver is in my golf bag now. It feels good to have Glen with
              me out on the course.

                You are at the Corn Maze on a fun activity trip for a Meetup.
                Suddenly, a Scarecrow hanging on a post just outside the maze
                comes alive, and begins chasing you. What happens next? 500
                words.

            <p>
              You know the kind of dream I talking about. The ones where you
              wake up and aren’t exactly sure if some part of it really happened
              or not.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Friday, the 30th, I drove by the farm where they put on the
              corn maze every year. Its on my way into town. I noticed “Old
              Dusty” the scarecrow ready to host his guests later that evening.
              His recessed black eyes look menacing enough and the left skeletal
              arm points toward the entrance to the maze. I remember thinking
              he’ll probably look even more sinister as dusk settles in,
              especially for kids.
            </p>

            <p>
              I haven’t been to a corn maze since my daughters were young,
              perhaps seven and nine. It wasn’t exactly a success either, my
              youngest was terrified by the ghosts projected on the walls of the
              abandoned farmhouse and had trouble sleeping for a few nights
              afterward. I look forward to the singles meetup the next evening –
              I need to get out of the house, try something new, and be with
              others. Otherwise, this reclusive widower will end up a hermit!
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m feeling a little apprehensive as I negotiate the turn into the
              corn maze’s parking area wondering just how many other men there
              will be in their forties. If not for Penny at work the odds of my
              attending a singles event would have been close to zero. However,
              she convinced me over the course of the last few weeks to give it
              a try, that it would be a good thing, that it was time to “get out
              there”, and lastly perhaps I could save her from any overly
              aggressive overtures from any of the gentlemen there. To this I
              replied “Sure, you can tell him your dad’s here to pick you up!”
            </p>

            <p>
              Surprised at the number of people here I finally spot Penny in
              conversation with another woman amongst a group of about twenty
              others. After we each introduce ourselves, it was time to head
              toward to main entrance to the maze with the scarecrow pointing
              the way.
            </p>

            <p>
              Penny notes “Old Dusty is the creepiest part of this whole
              adventure”.
            </p>

            <p>
              I introduce myself to Linda as we turn to the right at the first
              junction. She seems happy to have a walking partner as the light
              from the entrance diminishes. As she’s telling me about her work
              as an interior designer she stops in mid sentence and quickly
              turns around to look behind her.
            </p>

            <p>
              Seeing my questioning look she says “That’s twice that it feels
              like someone is pulling on my jacket”. “Oh, its probably that
              you’re catching on the corn stalks that are sticking out”, trying
              to sound reassuring, “Its not me if that’s what you’re thinking, I
              wouldn’t start teasing you until we’ve known each other for at
              least five minutes”. She’s quite attractive and I don’t want to
              scare her away.
            </p>

            <p>
              She smiles and says “Ok then” but I know she thinks I’m
              responsible for the tugging.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we make a left turn into increasing darkness she screams
              “Paul!”
            </p>

            <p>
              Simultaneously someone pushes me hard from behind. Linda has
              disappeared but I can only see a dead end to this branch of the
              maze. As I slowly backpedal and can feel Old Dusty’s warm musty
              breath as he closes in on me.

              Mercifully I’m saved as my annoying alarm sounds welcoming me to
              another day.

              I’m thinking of this dream as I approach the corn maze for the
              real singles meetup this time. I pass Old Dusty again staring at
              me as I enter the property, pass by and find a spot in the parking
              area. I find Penny in what must be our group. She introduces me to
              her friend – Linda!

              As our group ambles into the maze, I’m thinking of all these
              coincides when I notice that Old Dusty is no longer facing the
              road, he’s somehow turned 90 degrees and is now looking right at
              us…
